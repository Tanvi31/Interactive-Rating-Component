# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM.

The users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
